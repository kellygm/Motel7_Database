# Motel7_Database

This is the repository for my CS 374 group project (I have moved it my own repostiory so I can have access to it afer the class has ended). This database is an encapsulation of the Motel7 hotel chain.
<p>Each directory has its own README that explains the functionality of the material and the methidology we chose to implement. Motel7 is an expansive database that was collaborated on using the JMU serve and PgAdmin
to push and commit changes made. Unfortnately because it is a private school server I am unable to share it since I do not have administrative access, however all of the code is available in the directories. I am considering doing a screen recording walking through the database and all its tables and attribtues, if that is something you are interested in please reach out to me!</p>
